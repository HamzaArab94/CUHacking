# Digital FootPrint
CUHacking 2017 - "Digital FootPrint" is a web application that visualizes a Personalized Home Network of interconnected devices.  

# Inspiration
This project was inspired by Martello's Coding Challenge of creating an application that continuously collects and visualizes all of the devices which are connected on a simulated home network. 

# What it does
Our Hack displays a personlized dashboard of a user's connected devices in their home network. Martello's API is accessed, filtered, analyzed and sent to the user's Personalized Home Network which will display key information on all connected devices.  

# How we built it
Digital FootPrint is built using a Web application as the primary source of UI to the end users. Back End development is done in Python utilizing libraries such as Flask, Pandas, Numpy and urllib. The Web application is built through bootstrapping javascript/html/css. 

# Challenges we ran into
Some challenges the team ran into included fetching and cleaning the dataset from Martello's API an integration of both Front End and Back End of the project. 

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Built a sleak user interface for the web application. 
Team Members understood fundamental networking concepts and the Simple Network Management Protocol used to create the dataset for Martello's API. 
Complete the logic of the implementation.
Every member was able to learned new technologies. 
Team was able to work off each otherâ€™s skill sets while assisting one another on all aspects of the Hack.
The team is proud of the completion of an Web Application. 
The team gained development experience Bootstrapping for Web Development and Python Development. 

# What's next for Digital FootPrint
More projects, better outcomes
